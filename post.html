                        <p>In today’s world where everyone is trying to make it big in the stock market, this has made it necessary to carry out one’s own small-scale analysis before making any risky investments. Due to constant bombardment by news and social media channels about people acheiving extra-ordinary returns by betting big on small and risky companies, and adding to this, the ever-growing reach of digital media and rising asset prices has forced people to invest in these risky assets to not feel missed out. This makes it necessary to understand these organization before putting in any hard-earned capital. This can be achieved through Financial Statement Analysis. As this concept is too broad and technical to grasp in its entirety, we will be addressing a few key elements that will help us navigate through and build a picture about the characteristic and health of the company.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Financial Statements</h2>
                        <p>Financial statements if understood correctly will tell you a story about the company. It will tell you whether an organization is aggressively pursuing growth like most of the new-age tech companies) or focussed on providing consistent value/service to a target market like most of the brick-and-mortar companies or companies in capital intensive industries (energy, aviation, banking, real estate). By understanding the above nature of the businesses you will be better equipped as to how to go about reading this story.
<br><br>There are 3 parts to these statements:<br><br>
                            
1) Statement of Earnings <br>                       2) Balance Sheet     <br>          3) Statement of Cash Flows.
</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">1) Statement of Earnings</h2>
                        <p>This statement informs the reader about the most recent performance of the company as to how much business (revenue) the company was able to aggregate, what were the costs involved in getting the revenue and eventually what was the outcome (profit/losses) from these activities.  To better understand this one can also compare this with their monthly budget for e.g. their monthly salary being  revenue, bills being expenses and savings as profits. To amplify your understanding of the current performance these statements are always accompanied with a following quarter/year’s statements just beside them which helps evaluate how well did the company performed compared to previous quarter/year.</p>
                        <p> The one metric that sets the stage to your analysis is the revenue growth rate:</p><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Growth rate = Revenue 
                        <small>(current)</small> - Revenue<small>(previous)</small> /Revenue <small>(previous)</small> X 100<br><br>
For e.g.  Revenue <small>(current)</small> = $100,000 ; <br> Revenue <small>(previous)</small> = $80,000<br><br>
Growth Rate = ((100,000 – 80,000) / 80,000) X 100 = 20%.</p>
</blockquote>
                        
                        <p>For our evaluation any company with a growth rate of 20% and above can be categorized as a high-growth company and anything below that can be considered as a value company.
Now that we have a categorized these companies, we can further go about understanding them.</p> 

                        <h2 class="section-heading"><small>1.1) Dynamics of a High Growth Company:</small></h2>
                        <p>Such organizations operate in a market that is highly competitive and have a need to constantly innovate and keep up with the ever-changing demands of the customer leading to higher spending towards R&D/Product development costs. </p>
                        <p>Coupled with the increased R&D costs they also have to market their innovative solutions to their target market before the competition takes notice of their product/service potential. This leads to higher sales & marketing costs.</p>
                        <blockquote class="blockquote">Let’s understand the above statement with the help of an example: Lightspeed Commerce (Annual Report 2021); Revenue growth = 83.33%<br><br>As the individual costs would not have any significance by themselves, we compare the R&D and Marketing costs in terms of their revenue:<br><br>
R&D/Revenue = ($54,787,000/$221,728,000) x 100 = 24.7%<br><br>
Sales & Marketing/Revenue = ($97,048,000/$221,728,000) x 100 = 43.8% <br><br>
This signifies that the company is spending around 68% of its revenue on just these two expense items.
<br><br>

</blockquote>
                        <p>As most of these entities are in their early stages, their revenues are not significant and the above-mentioned high costs usually inhibit their ability to generate a profit, thereby causing these companies to have negative to no profits. Such entities usually finance their operations by giving up equity in their company as they do not have enough assets or credit to utilize debt financing.</p>
                        <p>Now this brings up a question as why do such companies have really high valuations, which we will address in another article?</p>
                            
                        <h2 class="section-heading"><small>1.2) Dynamics of a Value Company:</small></h2>
                        <p>Most of us have daily encounters with such companies as they have established themselves as a key player in their respective markets for e.g. Enbridge, Loblaws, Restaurant Brands International (Parent company of Tim Hortons) etc. Such organizations do not find the need to achieve a high growth as they already have a sizeable addressed market. This entails that they have found a right product that fits its market needs and have built a brand reputation in this category. Therefore, their R&D expense and Sales & Marketing expense is not as significant as compared to their high growth counterparts.</p>
                        <blockquote class="blockquote">Let’s understand the above statement with the help of an example: Restaurant Brands International (Annual Report 2020); Revenue growth = -11%<br><br>
R&D/Revenue = ($0/$4,968,000,000) x 100 = 0%<br><br>
Sales & Marketing/Revenue = ($1,264,000,000/$4,968,000,000) x 100 = 25.4% <br><br>
This signifies that the company is only spending around 25.4% of its revenue on these two expense items.<br><br>
<small>https://s26.q4cdn.com/317237604/files/doc_financials/2021/ar/QSR_2020.12.31_10K.pdf</small>
</blockquote>
                        <p>Such organizations are more inclined to use debt financing as they have enough assets and built-up enough credibility over the years which helps them in attaining low – cost debt financing. </p>
                        
                        <h2 class="section-heading">2) Balance Sheet (BS):</h2>
                        <p>This statement lets us know about the financial health of the company. It provides us with information regarding, whether the company has enough resources to carry on its operations. Also, how dependent the company is on debt financing and how effectively has it been using it.</p><p>Let’s first understand the most important principle of a balance sheet, before we move on to any technical aspect:</p>
                        <p><b>Assets = Liabilities + Equity</b></p>
                        
                       
                        <p>This means that all the assets the company owns is equal to the debt/liabilities the company has taken up plus the actual amount the company owns (equity). To better understand this consider you have a mortgage on your house which is valued at $500,000 of which you have paid off $300,000. This means you still have a liability of $200,000. Now considering this example, you have an Asset=$500,000 ; Liability = $200,000 ; Equity = $300,000.</p>
                        <p>The key ratio’s that we can consider here are:</p>
                        
                        
                        <h3 class="section-heading"> <small>2.1) Debt to Equity Ratio (D/E):</small> </h3>
                        <p>This metric tells us about how dependent the company is on debt financing, you obtain this figure by dividing the total debt that it owes divided by the equity of the shareholders. </p><blockquote class="blockquote"><medium>D/E = (Short-term Liabilities + Long-term Liabilities)/ Shareholder’s Equity <br><br>
Short-term Liabilities = Debt maturing within 1 year (BS)<br><br>
Long-term Liabilities = Debt maturing after 1 year (BS) <br><br></medium>

<small>*BS = metric obtained in Balance Sheet *SOE = metric obtained in Statement of Earnings *SOCF = metric obtained in Statement of Cash Flow</small>
</blockquote>
                        <p>Having a D/E ratio above “2” should grab your attention as it is dependent on too much debt to run its business. </p>
                        <p>This should not be a sole reason to neglect this entity as a potential debtor or investment, but as benchmark to further analysis. This leads us to our next metric:</p>
                        
                        
                        <h3 class="section-heading"> <small>2.2) Coverage Ratio OR Interest Coverage Ratio:</small> </h3>
                        <p>This ratio tells us if a company is able to efficiently service its debt obligations and it is calculated as follows: </p><blockquote class="blockquote"><medium>Coverage ratio = EBITDA / Interest Expense <br><br>
EBITDA = Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization OR Income from operations (SOE)<br><br>
Interest Expense = The amount it paid as an interest on its debt (SOE) <br><br></medium>
</blockquote>
                        <p>Moving on to another important ratio to consider in the balance sheet is Current Ratio.</p>
                        
                       
                        <h3 class="section-heading"> <small>2.3) Current Ratio (CR):</small> </h3>
                        <p>This ratio tells us if the organization has enough resources to run its business in the short term and it is calculated as follows,</p><blockquote class="blockquote"><medium>CR = Short-term Assets/ Short-term Liabilities<br><br>
Short-term Assets = These are assets which can be turned into cash within 1-year period (BS)<br><br>
Short-term Liabilities = These are financial/operational obligation that have to be met within 1-year period (BS) <br><br></medium>
</blockquote>
                        <p>Any metric around 1 entails that the company has enough resources to meet its short-term operational requirements.</p>
                        
                        
                        
                        <h2 class="section-heading">3)	Statement of Cash Flow (SOCF):</h2>
                        <p>This statement tells us through what activities did the companies generate its cash and how much was the aggregated amount which is listed in the “cash flow from operation activities”. It is then followed by how the cash was used by it “cash flow from investing activities” and then any additional cash that was raised using debt or equity financing “cash flow from financing activities”.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="section-heading"> <small> 3.1) Free Cash Flow (FCF):</small> </h3>
                        <p>For any self-sustaining business cash can be analogous as blood in a human body. If there is not enough blood such businesses can find themselves in a serious health condition. The most important aspect of this statement is that it informs us about how much cash (Free Cash Flow aka FCF) was left with the business after carrying out all its operating and investing activities.
This can be calculated as follows:
</p><blockquote class="blockquote"><medium>FCF = Cash Flow from Operating activities – Investment in property, plant and equipment </medium>
</blockquote>
                        <p>Having enough Free Cash Flow allows the company to fund its future business activities or give back some cash to investors in the form of dividends thereby driving the value of its business higher.</p>
                        
                        
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Sample Aanlysis:</h2>
                        <p>Now lets summarize everything with an example: Restaurant Brands International (Annual Report 2020) </p>
                        <blockquote class="blockquote"><medium>Revenue growth = -11.3%<br><br>Debt to Equity Ratio = (12,397 + 111) / 3,721 = 3.36 <br><br>Interest Coverage Ratio = 1,422 / 508 = 2.8 <br><br>Current Ratio = 2,264 / 1,601 = 1.4 <br><br>Free Cash Flow = 921 – 117 = $ 804 million <br><br> <small>https://s26.q4cdn.com/317237604/files/doc_financials/2021/ar/QSR_2020.12.31_10K.pdf</small></medium>
</blockquote>
                        <p>Based on the above metrics we understand that RBI is not aggressively pursuing growth and a strong decline of 11.3% is indicative of the impacts of covid shutdown in 2020 otherwise it had a stagnant revenue for quite some years.  Debt to Equity of 3.36 shows its heavy reliance on debt which leads us to questioning if it is able to manage its debt obligations comfortably. It is able to efficiently service its debt considering its coverage ratio of 2.8, which was usually higher at around 4 prior to covid. A current ratio of 1.4 is indicative of efficient use of company assets to meet current operational requirements, and a healthy bloodline (FCF) of $ 804 million dollars seals the mark that the company is in a financially healthy state.</p>
                        <p>Equipped with these simple tools one can go about knowing whether a business is healthy enough to be considered by a creditor or a potential investor. These tools will not provide an absolute answer but will serve as direction to your required analysis.</p>
