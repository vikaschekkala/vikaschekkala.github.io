                            A general rule of economics is that with rising demand for goods/services coupled with a short supply of the same, leads to an increase in the price for those goods/services.

                            <blockquote class blockquote> <small> The above graph of demand curve depicts that as the quantity of goods and servies increases the price for the same decreases and vice versa.</small></blockquote>

                            This scenario has been playing out quite evidently in today’s markets with excessive money printing by Central Banks coupled, with the supply constraints caused by Covid-19 and rising conflict in East Europe. This has led to excessive increase in the price of everyday essentials and other goods/services/assets.  This decrease in the value of fiat currencies in terms of their purchasing power has led to an increase in demand for financial assets, real estate and digital currencies thereby providing exceptional returns in the past couple years. 
                        
                        Now with the rising interest rate environment, the Central Banks intend to curb demand and cool off the economy. The current Inter Bank rates being at 1.71% as compared to about 0.45% a year before is a strong indicator of the Central Bank’s intentions.</p>

                            <p>This rising interest rate will cause people to borrow less and save, to take advantage of the higher interest rate thereby cutting demand and cooling off the prices. This would negatively affect the above-mentioned asset classes and therefore force us to look for a secure haven with a proven track record.</p>

                        Gold always had a sentimental value attached to it, since ages its presence is considered as a sign of prosperity and had been used as a currency across major empires until paper currency was introduced. Its properties like non-decaying which provides it with an unlimited life and there being only a limited amount of this metal on earth with its mining process being highly cost intensive makes it an ideal hold of value. Due to these factors, Central Banks around the world hold gold reserves to uphold the stability and credibility of their economy with USA holding about 8000 metric tonnes (source: statistica.com) of it. In times of market downturn when sentiments are at an all time low with decreasing asset prices. There is a shift towards assets that are good hold of value and do not have significant downside risk. Such instances create the perfect environment for holding gold as it safe guards the portfolio, and serves as a boon in times of need. The following chart shows the inflation adjusted performance of gold during the market downturns of 2001- dot com boom, 2008- housing crisis and 2020 Covid -19 crisis.

                    <p>In 2001 the markets fells by 40% during the period of June 2000 – September 2002 while gold provided a positive return of 6%.

                         In 2008 Housing crisis the markets fell by 50% during the period of Oct 2007 – March 2009 and gold provided a return of 16.9%.

                        In 2020 Covid-19 crisis the markets fell by 31% during Feb 2020 – March 2020 and gold lost a value of 1%.

                        The above statements depict the importance of gold as a diversification tool, and not as the only investment tool. As in the long run the stock market returns drastically outweigh the returns generated by gold and one should prefer to use it as a safe hold of value.

                    <p>
                    One way to invest in gold for retail investors is to buy Gold ETFs’ whose value is backed by actual holding of gold by the managing entity. One such ETF is iShare Gold Bullion Etf with the ticker symbol CGL.
