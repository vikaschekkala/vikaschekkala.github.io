            <div class="container px-4 px-lg-5">
                <div class="row gx-4 gx-lg-5 justify-content-center">

                        <p>
                            Excessive valuation for high growth unprofitable companies are representative of saturation in valuation of highly profitable companies and a shift towards riskier assets to earn above market returns. This phenomena which is usually seen in a booming economy that is representative of high demand for goods/services, which in turn leads to higher revenues for companies, leading to more jobs, and more spending power in the hands of consumer. Since the past two years there has been a total contradiction considering the impacts of Covid-19, like loss of jobs, reduction of demand and high rate of un-employment, yet risky and un-proven assets still attaining high valuations. This can be explained by liquidity induced by Central Banks all over the world to tackle the recessionary enviornment caused by Covid-19.          
                            
                             <h2 class="section-heading">"The un-intended results of Central Banks actions"</h2>
                        <p>
                        As businesses and industries were shut down to reduce the spread of virus, leaving people with no jobs and money to support themselves. This led the Central Banks to step in and provide liquidity to avoid a recession, which was done in the form of CERB, CEBA and lowering interest rates etc. This induced liquidity by the Central Bank  led to increased trust in the system by institutional investors thereby causing a quick recovery in financial markets as seen in the period of March 2020.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p> 
                        The sudden impact of Covid-19 made many people re-consider their line of work, as their previous jobs was no longer relevant for the current eoconomy. Also, understanding the importance of having financial security for such uncertain moments, led many individuals to save and invest to tackle any future uncertainties. This psycological change to save and invest coupled with money grants from Central Government, and sharp surge in stock market valuations seemed like the perfect answer to everyone's situation.

                        <p>
                        The surge in new retail participation caused increased demand for financial assets which in turn led to higher stock prices. The high liquidity induced by Central Banks and rising in-experienced retial particiaption led to excesses in certain sections of market which are associated with higher risks. High growth un-profitable companies being one category of this segment, they assure future profitability based on their revolutionary approach to address a market. Some of these entities may go on to become businesses of tomorrow, but future projections are always uncertain and should be met with proper due-diligence. These companies being valued at 60 to 70 times their revenues with no signs of self sustaining growth, are a reason for concern. 
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                        With inflation at a multi-decade high, the Central Bank is trying to drain excess liquidity from the economy by raising interest rates and making it hard for people to finance their purchases/debts. Therefore only businesses with sel-sustaining cash flows and financing options will be able to weather the oncoming effects monetary tightening.
